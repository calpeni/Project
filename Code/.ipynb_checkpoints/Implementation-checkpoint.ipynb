    "The dispersal:\n",
    "- destination is the vacant cell (vacant due to death)\n",
    "- start point is the parent's cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program:\n",
    "- randomly picks the parent from a probability distribution - the probability of each parent's offspring dispersing to the vacant position\n",
    "- calculates probabilities using the individuals' dispersal kernels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Individuals do not have the same chance of being chosen, as their dispersal ability varies (i.e. the probability distribution is not uniform). (The shape of dispersal kernels varies. It depends on the individual's size and the temperature of its position.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Dispersal occurs by randomly picking a distance along each axis.\n",
    "To apply a metabolic effect to dispersal ability, calculate distance as follows:\n",
    "- Randomly pick a number from a normal distribution (location 0, scale 1).\n",
    "- Multiply the number by a variable, 'x', which is the output of metabolic scaling.\n",
    "- Distance is a continuous variable, but the landscape is divided into discrete units (position is a discrete variable). So, use the floor of the distance (round it down to the next integer)$^1$.\n",

    "However, the program does this in reverse, as it must calculate dispersal probabilities before it runs the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "$^1$ I do not round up as, if I did, only a raw distance of 0 would give a rounded distance of 0 (any raw distance greater than 0 and less than or equal 1, would round to 1).\n",

    "To go from one point to another, offspring obviously must move the distance between the points. However, this is the minimum distance they must go; they may go a more tortuous route, theoretically up to an infinite distance. So, the probability of dispersing from one point to another, is the probability of going *at least* the distance between them. This is calculated as:  \n",

    "## Dispersal Map\n",

    "- Separately considers the destination's r and theta position (i.e., it separately considers dispersal along each axis).\n",
    "- Makes an array containing, for each r point in the landscape, the probability of dispersing to the destination r.\n",

    "- A mountain base covers more area than the top.\n",
    "- While the model landscape is a circle sector, in silico, it is a rectangular array. Each row is an altitudinal band.\n",
    "- So, going up the mountain, each grid cell represents an ever narrower area.\n",
    "- Thus, the theta distance must be scaled according to the radial position.\n",
    "- Movement in theta follows an arc of a circumference, so divide distance by circumference length, $2\\pi r$ (the radial position gives the radius).\n",
    "- The program separately considers dispersal along each axis. Whether it considers r or theta first matters, as the theta distance is scaled according to the radial position. *I assume it is sufficient to calculate theta distance, using the radial position halfway between the start and destination - the average.*\n",
