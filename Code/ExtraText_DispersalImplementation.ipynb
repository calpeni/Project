Thus, in theta, dispersal from one given point to another can occur in either direction. Moreover, it can occur via any number of loops around the mountain. *I calculate dispersal probabilities using only the shortest route.*\n",

    "While the landscape is a circle sector, in silico, it is a rectangular array. Each column is an altitudinal band. So, going up the mountain, each grid cell represents an ever narrower area. Thus, the theta distance must be scaled according to the radial position, when converting from metres to a number of cells. Movement in theta follows an arc of a circumference. The distance in number of cells equals the proportion of the circumference traveled. Circumference length = $2\\pi r$, and the radial position gives the radius. Thus:  \n",

    "The program separately considers dispersal along each axis. Whether it considers r or theta first matters, as the theta distance is scaled according to the radial position. For a given theta distance in number of cells, the equivalent in metres changes going up the mountain. In other words, as an individual moves down/up, across rows, to reach a destination, the distance it must move along a row changes. It is better to use the diagonal distance between the start and destination. Use Pythagoras' Theorem to calculate this, with the diagonal distance as a triangle's hypotenuse, and r and theta destances as the other sides. But this would be hard, due to the change in area up the mountain. **I assume it is sufficient to calculate theta distance, using the radial position halfway between the start and destination - the average.** The model is a simplification; of course, it does not capture the complex reality of dispersal.\n",
