    "- calculates probabilities using the individuals' dispersal kernels.\n",

    "Individuals do not have the same chance of being chosen, as their dispersal ability varies (i.e. the probability distribution is not uniform). (The shape of dispersal kernels varies. It depends on the individual's size and the temperature of its position.)\n",

    "- Randomly pick a number from a normal distribution (location 0, scale 1).\n",
    "- Multiply the number by a variable, 'x', which is the output of metabolic scaling.\n",

Whether it considers r or theta first matters, as the theta distance is scaled according to the radial position. *I assume it is sufficient to calculate theta distance, using the radial position halfway between the start and destination - the average.*\n",
