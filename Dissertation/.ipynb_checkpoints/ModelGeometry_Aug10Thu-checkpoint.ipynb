    "# Method\n",
    "To simplify reality, neutral models assume individuals are ecologically equivalent. This does not necessarily mean individuals have identical traits, it means trait variation is independent of species identity. The models consist of a community and proceed in discrete, uniform time steps. In each step, a randomly-chosen individual dies. With probability v, they are replaced by a new species. With probability 1 - v, they are replaced, via dispersal, by the offspring of another randomly-chosen individual. For convenience, the models make a zero-sum assumption: Birth and death balance (dead individuals are immediately replaced), so the number of individuals is constant (Hubbell 2001; Rosindell et al 2008, 2011).\n",
    "\n",
    "I begin with a two-dimensional, spatially explicit version: Individuals occupy cells in a grid, representing positions in space. When individuals reproduce, offspring disperse according to a dispersal kernel - a probability distribution of dispersal distances. In a basic model, death, birth, speciation, and dispersal rates do not vary across individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "I add an altitudinal temperature gradient that drives variation in death, birth, and dispersal, as predicted by Metabolic Theory. To explore the effect of area, I vary the number of individuals in a cell. Finally, I envision the community consists of guilds; individuals in a guild have the same body size. Each guild is a separate simulation. Among guilds, dispersal ability and the total number of individuals differ, as predicted by allometric scaling. So, temperature drives variation within simulations, whereas body size drives it across simulations. Initally, the model is fully neutral: In a simulation, species are equivalent - individual variation is independent of species identity. However, as explained later, species have a thermal optimum, so the model moves away from neutrality."

    "## Population Density\n",
    "Each cell in the array has $n$ individuals; $n$ is a function of body mass and area. Population density (number of individuals per unit area) should decline with body mass as $M^{-0.75}$, if resource supply is constant. This is because individual resource demand depends on metabolic rate, which increases with body mass as $M^{0.75}$. Observations in animals and plants support this (Enquist et al 1998; Damuth 1987). A mountain base covers more area than the top. The model mountain is a cone, but, in silico, it is a square array. So, going up the mountain, each cell in the array represents an increasingly narrow area. If $A_c$ is cell area, the number of individuals in a cell is:\n",

    "## Dispersal\n",
    "Individuals do not move, but species disperse via birth and death (when an individual reproduces, its offspring fills a gap vacant due to a death). An individual's chance of being chosen to reproduce depends on its birth rate, dispersal ability, and distance from the destination (vacant position). In other words, it is the net probability of birth and dispersal. The challenge is that, across space, birth and dispersal rates vary. The solution is a set of probability distributions."
